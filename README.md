# Full Cycle - Docker Challenge!

This repository is to solve a challenge made in the [Full Cycle course](https://fullcycle.com.br/) 
DockerHub image: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/vitor96k/golang-hello-world-prod

## Description

It was necessary to create a hello world program for the [Go language](https://go.dev/). This app must run on docker and its image must have less than 2 Megabytes.

## Running using image from Docker Hub

     docker run vitor96k/golang-hello-world-prod

## Running without Docker Hub

    docker build -t vitor96k/golang-hello-world-prod . -f Dockerfile.prod
    docker run vitor96k/golang-hello-world-prod


## Running user docker-compose

     docker-compose up --build
 Disclaimer: The compose does not use the prod image, so the image generated by the compose will have more than 2 MegaBytes.
